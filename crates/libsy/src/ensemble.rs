//! Ensemble router built on the [`Algorithm`] interfaces.
//!
//! Each request is fanned out to a set of candidate models concurrently; a judge
//! model (e.g. Haiku) then picks the best response, which is returned to the
//! agent. The algorithm tallies which candidate the judge preferred across
//! requests and, after `exploration_turns` ensemble turns, commits to the
//! winningest model — every subsequent request routes straight to that one model
//! with no fan-out and no judge call.
//!
//! Unlike the reference routers, this algorithm is **stateful**: the win tally,
//! turn counter, and committed choice live behind a [`std::sync::Mutex`] so one
//! shared `&self` can serve a session's requests concurrently (see the
//! `Algorithm` docs). In a proxy setup one `EnsembleOrchAlgo` is created per session,
//! so this state is per-session.
